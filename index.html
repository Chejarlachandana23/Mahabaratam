                      Formerly, the spirited and virtuous Krishna-Dwaipayana, by the injunctions of Bhishma, the wise son of Ganga and of his own mother,
                      became the father of three boys who were like the three fires by the two wives of Vichitra-virya; and having thus raised up Dhritarashtra,
                      Pandu and Vidura, he returned to his recluse ...

                      Śisupala's origin story provides some explanation for why Śisupala dislikes Krishna so much (because he believes one day Krishna is going to kill him). 
                      Krishna is both a blessing and a curse for Śisupala—he removes Śisupala's extra features and offers to forgive his sins, but this comes at the cost of killing him.

                      THE KILLING OF KIRMIRA. Dhritarashtra hears a story about how Bhima killed a Rakshasa called Kirmira. He asks Vidura to tell him the story. 
                      Kirmira wanted to kill Bhima for killing his brother Baka, but Bhima defeated him and killed him in a wrestling match

                          The Mahabharata is an epic that comprises one hundred thousand stanzas of verse
                          divided into eighteen books, or parvas. It is the largest single literary work in existence.
                          Originally composed in the ancient language of Sanskrit sometime between 400 BC and
                          400 AD, it is set in a legendary era thought to correspond to the period of Indian culture
                          and history in approximately the tenth century BC.
                          The original “author” was Vyasa who tried to tell about the Great War between the
                          Pandavas and the Kauravas - cousins who claimed to be the rightful rulers of a kingdom.
                          The background to get to where the epic starts is very confusing (in medias res). I’ll
                          present the background a bit here just to lay the groundwork.
